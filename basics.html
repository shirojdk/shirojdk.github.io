        <h1>The Deck</h1>
        <p>Each player can compose their deck of 40-60 cards in their main deck, 15 cards in their extra deck, and 15 cards in the side deck.<br> Players can have up to 3 cards with the same name in their deck at one time.</p>
        <h1>Starting the Game</h1>
        <h2>Who Goes First</h2>
        <p>Usually people will play Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide who goes first. <br> other ways to pick who goes first can be a coin toss or a die roll to. <br> its up to both players to decide how they choose.</p>
        <h2>The Field</h2>

        <p>Here is a printable playmat that is labeled.<br> Each zone represents diffrent things but the main things to note as of now are the main deck, extra deck, main monster, and spell/trap zones.<br> The <em>"Main Deck"</em> zone is where you should put your deck upon the game starting.<br> The <em>"Extra Deck"</em> similarly belongs in its extra deck zone. <br> When you summon monsters you will play them in the main monster zone and when you play spell/traps your put them in the spell/trap zone. <br> Yhe side deck does not get a zone and instead is kept seprate from the game being played.</p>
        <h2>Setting Up</h2>
        <p>Both players start the game by shuffling their deck and allowing their opponent to cut each others deck.<br> Cutting is the act of allowing your opponent to randomly grab any amount of cards from the top of your opponent deck and place it place it under the part they didnt grab.<br> People do this to keep others from stacking their deck.<br> After cutting each player draws 5 cards and then the duel starts.</p>
