        <h1>The Objective</h1>
        <p>In Yu-Gi-Oh!, both players start the duel with 8000 life points.<br> There are multiple possible objectives to win, but the main one is to get your opponents life points to zero.</p>
        <h1>Phases</h1>
        <p>Yu-Gi-Oh! sperates parts of the turn in five different phases.
        <ul> 
            <li>The draw phase is when the turn player draws a card to start their turn. </li>
            <li>The Standby phase is a phase between the draw phase and the main phase. Its a buffer that somr effects can activate.</li> 
            <li>The main phase is where the game as you it know it is played. Its where you can summon monsters and activate spell/trap card. </li> 
            <li>The battle phase is where the turn player gets to declair attacks using their monsters. </li>
            <li>Main phase 2 acts as a second main phase so players can do a bit more before ending their turn. You have to go into Battle phase if you want to enter the second main phase though.</li> 
            <li>The end phase is you pass the turn to your opponent. In order for players to progress through the game, both players must agree to move from phase to phase. </li>
            </ul>
        <h1>The Deck</h1>
        <p>Each player can compose their deck of 40-60 cards in their main deck, 15 cards in their extra deck, and 15 cards in the side deck.<br> Players can have up to 3 cards with the same name in their deck at one time.</p>
        <h1>Starting the Game</h1>
        <h2>Who Goes First</h2>
        <p>Usually people will play Rock, Paper, Scissors to decide who goes first. <br> other ways to pick who goes first can be a coin toss or a die roll to. <br> its up to both players to decide how they choose.</p>
        <h2>The Field</h2>

        <p>Here is a printable playmat that is labeled.<br> Each zone represents different things but the main things to note as of now are the main deck, extra deck, main monster, and spell/trap zones.<br> The <em>"Main Deck"</em> zone is where you should put your deck upon the game starting.<br> The <em>"Extra Deck"</em> similarly belongs in its extra deck zone. <br> When you summon monsters you will play them in the main monster zone and when you play spell/traps your put them in the spell/trap zone. <br> The side deck does not get a zone and instead is kept separate from the game being played.</p>
        <h2>Setting Up</h2>
        <p>Both players start the game by shuffling their deck and allowing their opponent to cut each others deck.<br> Cutting is the act of allowing your opponent to randomly grab any amount of cards from the top of your opponent deck and place it place it under the part they didnt grab.<br> People do this to keep others from stacking their deck.<br> After cutting each player draws 5 cards and then the duel starts.</p>
        <h2>Other General Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The first Turn layer does get to draw to start the duel </li>
            <li> The player who goes second does get to draw at the start of their turn</li>
            <li>The player who goes first cannot declair an attack on their turn.</li>
        </ul>
